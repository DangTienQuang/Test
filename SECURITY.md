## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our Data Labeling System seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report
**Do NOT open a public issue** on GitHub/GitLab. Publicly reporting a vulnerability can allow malicious actors to exploit it before we have a chance to fix it.

Instead, please report the vulnerability via email to the project maintainer:

* **Email:** [dangquangtien16102002]@gmail.com
* **Subject:** [SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - Data Labeling API

### What to Include
To help us triage and fix the issue quickly, please include:
1.  **Description:** A clear description of the vulnerability (e.g., JWT Token bypass, IDOR on User Delete API, SQL Injection).
2.  **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed steps or a script (cURL/Postman) to reproduce the issue.
3.  **Impact:** How this vulnerability could affect the system (e.g., unauthorized data access, privilege escalation).

### Response Timeline
* We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours**.
* We aim to fix critical vulnerabilities within **1 week**.
* You will be notified once the fix is deployed.
